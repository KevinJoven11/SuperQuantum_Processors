# Superconducting Quantum Processors Design
In this repository we use Qiskit Metal to design some of the most common superconducting quantum architecture. The principal idea is to providad most state of the art in the superconducting architectures.

At the momento all the components are just base on transmon qubits and CPW.

## Two-Qubit superconducting design - [Two_Qubit.ipynb]

This contain the design of a two qubit superconducting circuit using Qiskit Metal. This design is base of the paper of "Demostration of Two-Qubit Algorithm with a Superconducting Quantum Processor" which I used to create.

## Four-Qubit superconducting design - [Four_Qubit.ipynb]

This contain the design of a four qubit superconducting circuit using Qiskit Metal. This design is base of the paper of "Digital Quantum Simulation of Spin Models with Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics" which I used to create.
