# Superconducting Quantum Processors Design
In this repository we use Qiskit Metal to design some of the most common superconducting quantum architecture. The principal idea is to providad most state of the art in the superconducting architectures.

At the momento all the components are just base on transmon qubits and CPW.

## Two-Qubit superconducting design
